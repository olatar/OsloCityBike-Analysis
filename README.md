# Daily trip distribution analysis of Oslo bicycle-sharing system using PCA and K-means clustering

### Final project in CYPLAN 257

## Abstract

This paper serves as an introductory analysis of the trip dynamics in Oslo bicycle-sharing system (BSS), Oslo Bysykkel, using the trip distribution histograms from the weekday trip data of 2019, as well as some demographic information of the city. The results show that Oslo BSS is heavily influenced by a work/school commuter pattern.
